<p><strong>There are innumerable examples of President Trump showing his racial prejudices against people of colour, his words and actions have emboldened white nationalists. Below I will list a handful of examples of his racist rhetoric.</strong></p>
<p>From his tweet of a fake anti-muslim video^<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html?referer=&referer=">[1]</a> to his actions in gutting programs meant to stop right-wing terrorism,<sup><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/trump-shut-countering-violent-extremism-program/574237/">[2]</a> he will inevitably create more racial tension that will lead to racially motivated violence. When you had white nationalist and supremacy sympathizers in this administration such as Gorka</sup><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-trump-aide-wears-medal-of-hungarian-nazi-collaborators/">[3]</a> and Bannon,<sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-steve-bannon-breitbart-news-alt-right-charlottesville">[4]</a> while continuing to have the likes of  Stephen Miller</sup><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/15/are-there-white-nationalists-white-house/">[5]</a> in the White House it only further emboldens the White Supremacists and racists.</p>
<p>This is why so many of us are have been concerned by the actions of President. Did you watch the President's unhinged press conference after the Charlottesville tragedy? I have never seen any head of state of a Western ally act in such a belligerent manner, he went so far as to defend Neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville Neo-Nazi rally. You can watch the entire press conference on PBS.<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbOr0WlA4SI">[6]</a> How about his Arizona speech where he went on a tirade against the fake media, read out his previous words from the press conference while leaving out the most important and controversial bit - fine people on many sides, on many sides - equivocating Neo-Nazis with counter protesters and referring to them as fine people.</sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/08/22/545226284/trump-heads-to-arizona-to-push-border-wall-funding-rally-supporters">[7]</a> He is defending Neo-Nazis. This was a Neo-Nazi rally. There were no &quot;fine&quot; people on both sides. They were making Nazi salutes, flying Nazi flags, wearing Nazi clothes, making Nazi chants. Here is a documentary by VICE News of the Neo-Nazi rally that took place, the one President Trump vehemently defended by stating that there were fine people on this side too.^<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54sP0Nlngg">[8]</a></p>
<p><strong>So what raised our suspicions as to why we believe President Trump holds racial prejudices against people of colour?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His public insistence that President Obama wasn't born in America is a racist conspiracy.^<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html">[9]</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1989 he wanted 5 innocent African-American boys to be executed for a heinous crime they did not commit. They were imprisoned for decades until DNA evidence exonerated them of the crime. A settlement was reached  between the 5 men and the city of New York for $40 million, yet Trump was still attacking the 5 innocent African-American men.^<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-the-central-park-five">[10]</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1973 the Justice Department filed a civil rights case accusing the Trump organization for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 for discriminating against people for colour.^<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html?utm_term=.0f29a95e7be3">[11]</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As President he went so far as to attack a judge who was presiding over a lawsuit against the President's fraudulent Trump University, he argued that the judge was biased due to his Latin-American ancestry.<sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/481140881/who-is-judge-gonzalo-curiel-the-man-trump-attacked-for-his-mexican-ancestry">[12]</a> It should also be noted that President Trump donated $25,000 to Florida Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi and AG Bondi decided not to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University.</sup><a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/12/18/trump-foundation-which-donated-25k-to-florida-ag-pam-bondi-ordered-to-dissolve-for-illegal-activity">[13]</a> The donation was done through the Trump Foundation. The Trump Foundation was investigated over a number of issues^<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/14/new-york-ag-files-lawsuit-against-trump-foundation-for-alleged-illegal-conduct-trump-says-wont-settle.html">[14]</a> and recently dissolved following an investigation led by the New York Attorney General.^<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/nyregion/ny-ag-underwood-trump-foundation.html">[15]</a></p>
