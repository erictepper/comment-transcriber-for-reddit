**There are innumerable examples of President Trump showing his racial prejudices against people of colour, his words and actions have emboldened white nationalists. Below I will list a handful of examples of his racist rhetoric.**

From his tweet of a fake anti-muslim video^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html?referer=&referer=) to his actions in gutting programs meant to stop right-wing terrorism,^[[2]](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/trump-shut-countering-violent-extremism-program/574237/) he will inevitably create more racial tension that will lead to racially motivated violence. When you had white nationalist and supremacy sympathizers in this administration such as Gorka^[[3]](https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-trump-aide-wears-medal-of-hungarian-nazi-collaborators/) and Bannon,^[[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-steve-bannon-breitbart-news-alt-right-charlottesville) while continuing to have the likes of  Stephen Miller^[[5]](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/15/are-there-white-nationalists-white-house/) in the White House it only further emboldens the White Supremacists and racists.

This is why so many of us are have been concerned by the actions of President. Did you watch the President's unhinged press conference after the Charlottesville tragedy? I have never seen any head of state of a Western ally act in such a belligerent manner, he went so far as to defend Neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville Neo-Nazi rally. You can watch the entire press conference on PBS.^[[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbOr0WlA4SI) How about his Arizona speech where he went on a tirade against the fake media, read out his previous words from the press conference while leaving out the most important and controversial bit - fine people on many sides, on many sides - equivocating Neo-Nazis with counter protesters and referring to them as fine people.^[[7]](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/22/545226284/trump-heads-to-arizona-to-push-border-wall-funding-rally-supporters) He is defending Neo-Nazis. This was a Neo-Nazi rally. There were no "fine" people on both sides. They were making Nazi salutes, flying Nazi flags, wearing Nazi clothes, making Nazi chants. Here is a documentary by VICE News of the Neo-Nazi rally that took place, the one President Trump vehemently defended by stating that there were fine people on this side too.^[[8]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54sP0Nlngg)

**So what raised our suspicions as to why we believe President Trump holds racial prejudices against people of colour?**

- His public insistence that President Obama wasn't born in America is a racist conspiracy.^[[9]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html) 

- In 1989 he wanted 5 innocent African-American boys to be executed for a heinous crime they did not commit. They were imprisoned for decades until DNA evidence exonerated them of the crime. A settlement was reached  between the 5 men and the city of New York for $40 million, yet Trump was still attacking the 5 innocent African-American men.^[[10]](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-the-central-park-five)  

- In 1973 the Justice Department filed a civil rights case accusing the Trump organization for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 for discriminating against people for colour.^[[11]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html?utm_term=.0f29a95e7be3) 

- As President he went so far as to attack a judge who was presiding over a lawsuit against the President's fraudulent Trump University, he argued that the judge was biased due to his Latin-American ancestry.^[[12]](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/481140881/who-is-judge-gonzalo-curiel-the-man-trump-attacked-for-his-mexican-ancestry) It should also be noted that President Trump donated $25,000 to Florida Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi and AG Bondi decided not to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University.^[[13]](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/12/18/trump-foundation-which-donated-25k-to-florida-ag-pam-bondi-ordered-to-dissolve-for-illegal-activity) The donation was done through the Trump Foundation. The Trump Foundation was investigated over a number of issues^[[14]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/14/new-york-ag-files-lawsuit-against-trump-foundation-for-alleged-illegal-conduct-trump-says-wont-settle.html) and recently dissolved following an investigation led by the New York Attorney General.^[[15]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/nyregion/ny-ag-underwood-trump-foundation.html)
