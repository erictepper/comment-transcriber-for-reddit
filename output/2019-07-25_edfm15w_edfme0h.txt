**There are innumerable examples of President Trump showing his racial prejudices
against people of colour, his words and actions have emboldened white
nationalists. Below I will list a handful of examples of his racist rhetoric.**

From his tweet of a fake anti-muslim
video^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html?referer=&referer=)
to his actions in gutting programs meant to stop right-wing
terrorism,^[[2]](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/trump-shut-countering-violent-extremism-program/574237/)
he will inevitably create more racial tension that will lead to racially
motivated violence. When you had white nationalist and supremacy sympathizers in
this administration such as
Gorka^[[3]](https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-trump-aide-wears-medal-of-hungarian-nazi-collaborators/)
and
Bannon,^[[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-steve-bannon-breitbart-news-alt-right-charlottesville)
while continuing to have the likes of Stephen
Miller^[[5]](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/15/are-there-white-nationalists-white-house/)
in the White House it only further emboldens the White Supremacists and racists.

This is why so many of us are have been concerned by the actions of President.
Did you watch the President's unhinged press conference after the Charlottesville
tragedy? I have never seen any head of state of a Western ally act in such a
belligerent manner, he went so far as to defend Neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville
Neo-Nazi rally. You can watch the entire press conference on
PBS.^[[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbOr0WlA4SI) How about his Arizona
speech where he went on a tirade against the fake media, read out his previous
words from the press conference while leaving out the most important and
controversial bit - fine people on many sides, on many sides - equivocating
Neo-Nazis with counter protesters and referring to them as fine
people.^[[7]](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/22/545226284/trump-heads-to-arizona-to-push-border-wall-funding-rally-supporters)
He is defending Neo-Nazis. This was a Neo-Nazi rally. There were no "fine" people
on both sides. They were making Nazi salutes, flying Nazi flags, wearing Nazi
clothes, making Nazi chants. Here is a documentary by VICE News of the Neo-Nazi
rally that took place, the one President Trump vehemently defended by stating
that there were fine people on this side
too.^[[8]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54sP0Nlngg)

**So what raised our suspicions as to why we believe President Trump holds racial
prejudices against people of colour?**

- His public insistence that President Obama wasn't born in America is a racist
conspiracy.^[[9]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html)

- In 1989 he wanted 5 innocent African-American boys to be executed for a heinous
crime they did not commit. They were imprisoned for decades until DNA evidence
exonerated them of the crime. A settlement was reached between the 5 men and the
city of New York for $40 million, yet Trump was still attacking the 5 innocent
African-American
men.^[[10]](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-the-central-park-five)

- In 1973 the Justice Department filed a civil rights case accusing the Trump
organization for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 for discriminating
against people for
colour.^[[11]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html?utm_term=.0f29a95e7be3)

- As President he went so far as to attack a judge who was presiding over a
lawsuit against the President's fraudulent Trump University, he argued that the
judge was biased due to his Latin-American
ancestry.^[[12]](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/481140881/who-is-judge-gonzalo-curiel-the-man-trump-attacked-for-his-mexican-ancestry)
It should also be noted that President Trump donated $25,000 to Florida
Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi and AG Bondi decided not to investigate
fraud allegations against Trump
University.^[[13]](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/12/18/trump-foundation-which-donated-25k-to-florida-ag-pam-bondi-ordered-to-dissolve-for-illegal-activity)
The donation was done through the Trump Foundation. The Trump Foundation was
investigated over a number of
issues^[[14]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/14/new-york-ag-files-lawsuit-against-trump-foundation-for-alleged-illegal-conduct-trump-says-wont-settle.html)
and recently dissolved following an investigation led by the New York Attorney
General.^[[15]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/nyregion/ny-ag-underwood-trump-foundation.html)

| **The President is creating a government shutdown crisis predicated on lies and
| racist rhetoric about illegal immigration.**
| 
| According to the right wing think tank the CATO Institute, President Trump's
| administration has provided an incredibly misleading narrative about illegal
| immigration and
| crime.^[[1]](https://www.cato.org/blog/white-houses-misleading-error-ridden-narrative-immigrants-crime)
| 
| >But we should not tolerate the peddling of misleading statistics without
| context. What matters is how dangerous these subpopulations are relative to each
| other so the government can allocate resources to prevent the greatest number of
| murders possible. Thus, enforcing immigration law more harshly is an ineffective
| way to punish a population that is less likely to murder or commit crimes than
| native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are
| less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than
| native-born Americans are.
| 
| The Washington Post compiled statistical charts that indicate the Trump
| administration is lying when they claim illegal immigration is a crisis. They
| disprove Trump's lies including immigrants flooding the border (they're not),
| that they bring crime (they don't), and that they're a drain on the economy (they
| aren't).^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/21/theres-no-immigration-crisis-and-these-charts-prove-it/?utm_term=.5a93c2cb02fa)
| 
| >The administration has said that the country is in danger of being “overwhelmed”
| by “massive increases in illegal crossings” that will bring “horrible crime,”
| “unbelievably great taxpayer expense” and the loss of American jobs.
| 
| >None of those claims are true.
| 
| >...Here's what we can say in conclusion. Current rates of illegal immigration
| remain extremely low by historic standards. Legal and undocumented immigrants are
| significantly less likely to commit most crimes than native-born citizens, making
| them a net benefit to public safety. The research shows that immigrants are not
| taking jobs away from U.S. natives, and their impact on wages appears to be small
| to nonexistent, particularly across the long term.
| 
| **President Trump's rhetoric is incredibly dangerous and is reminiscent of
| authoritarian leaders who have committed crimes against humanity.**
| 
| The President's rhetoric - his referral to undocumented immigrants as
| *"infesting"* the United States is incredibly dangerous and it is not the first
| time he has alluded to white nationalist talking points. First he tweeted
| it^[[3]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/19/republican-pressure-intensifies-to-end-family-separations-at-border.html)
| followed by him saying this as a statement during a speech later in the
| day.^[[4]](http://fox2now.com/2018/06/19/trump-ramps-up-rhetoric-dems-want-illegal-immigrants-to-infest-our-country/)
| Moreover, former Trump Campaign Chairman Cory Lewandowski went on national
| television and dehumanized a child with Down Syndrome who had been separated from
| their
| family.^[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/20/womp-womp-outrage-after-corey-lewandowski-mocks-story-of-child-with-down-syndrome-separated-from-parents/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.18f884832b12)
| President Trump has peddled anti-semetic conspiracies including the conspiracy
| that a prominent Jew is behind the migrant
| caravans^[[6]](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/414171-trump-i-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-soros-were-paying-for-migrant-caravan)
| that he claims are *"invading"* the
| country.^[[7]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-defends-calling-migrant-caravan-an-invasion-ahead-of-midterm-elections)
| And Fox News has repeated extremely dangerous xenophobic rhetoric that these
| migrants are bringing diseases with them, they're
| not.^[[8]](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/1/18048332/migrant-caravan-fox-news-disease-smallpox-outbreaks-vaccines-xenophobia)
| 
| Some experts have compared the President's statements to Nazi
| propaganda.^[[9]](https://www.timesofisrael.com/critics-say-trumps-description-of-immigrants-recalls-nazi-propaganda/)
| 
| >Social commentators pointed out that history has shown, particularly before and
| during the Holocaust, that “infest” — a term almost exclusively used to describe
| vermin — dehumanizes a population and is often a precursor to murder or genocide.
| 
| >“Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal
| immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country,
| like MS-13,” the president tweeted. “They can’t win on their terrible policies,
| so they view them as potential voters!”
| 
| >One of the most notorious anti-Semitic films produced by Nazi Germany’s Ministry
| of Propaganda was “Der ewige Jude” (“The Eternal Jew”), with input from
| propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
| 
| >The US Holocaust Memorial Museum says that “One of the film’s most notorious
| sequences compares Jews to rats that carry contagion, flood the continent, and
| devour precious resources.”
| 
| **These xenophobic conspiracy theories are incredibly dangerous. Recently a far
| right conspiracist murdered 11 people in a
| Synagogue.^[[10]](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-suspect-threatened-jewish-groups-pushed-migrant-caravan-n925256)
| The murderer believed in the same xenophobic, racist conspiracies that were being
| peddled by members of the GOP, President Trump and the American rightwing media
| sphere.^[[11]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/29/how-trumps-conservative-media-helped-mainstream-conspiracy-theory-now-tied-tragedy/?utm_term=.005def0fb638)**
