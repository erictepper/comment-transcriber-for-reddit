Didn’t Reggie Fils-Aime say that Nintendo didn’t want to reveal trailers or
announce games that weren’t coming out soon? I believe he said this after last
year’s E3, so he was probably aware of the Metroid 4 debacle.

Anyway, I’m NOT saying that I think this game will come out next year, but I am
saying that im having a hard time not getting my hopes up for a 2020 release...

| That cutscene certainly looked polished enough. At first I thought it was a third
| DLC pack. I could see this being a Holiday 2020 release. We never got this level
| of footage from BOTW until the very same 2017 I think.

| edit: 2016 not 2017

| | We got footage + a playable E3 demo in 2016.

| | | Oh right. That's the one I was thinking of. I for some reason thought botw
| | | released on Nov 2017 so I though E3 2017 was the whole demo. My bad.
| | | 
| | | Edit: but 2016 was the actual first look right? During the Switch presentation I
| | | think? With actual footage of in-game cutscenes and gameplay. I think we only had
| | | teasers and off-screen footage before that point.

| | | | The switch presentation was in January of 2017 I believe. We had seen BotW
| | | | playable on Wii U at E3 2016.

| | | | | Well I am mixing up the dates completely then. My point being the release date of
| | | | | botw and the first reveal of game footage was a very short time span. Less than a
| | | | | year.

| | | | | | Yeah. The world and physics engine are what took the longest to develop, I
| | | | | | believe. Pretty sure Nintendo has said that. So since they’re presumably reusing
| | | | | | both, it shouldn’t be too long before we get this game. :D

| | | | | | | I think the Botw development timeline is a special one. The physics engine was a
| | | | | | | huge factor, but I am guessing that the decision to bring it to Switch was done
| | | | | | | halfway through, so some effort had to be done to port parts of the game. They
| | | | | | | also probably also delayed the game to be a Switch launch title. I think the game
| | | | | | | was ready to be released by Holiday 2016 on Wii U, they just waited to release it
| | | | | | | with the Switch to boost the new console's launch game.
| | | | | | | 
| | | | | | | So, delay to match Switch release, delay to focus efforts on a two console
| | | | | | | release instead of one, and the whole physics engine delay.
| | | | | | | 
| | | | | | | New Zelda will probably not suffer from many of these and they seem to be
| | | | | | | reutilizing some assets. Besides, Nintendo has had a track of releasing games for
| | | | | | | Switch in a short span after reveal (Odyssey, Yoshi, Ultimate).
