Privacy Policy

Information is collected and stored solely from the comments requested in the process of transcription. This information includes:
 - The usernames of those that made the comments, if available, at the time of transcription. 
 - The point count of the comments at the time of transcription. 
 - The dates the comments were made in UTC. 
 - The comment-ids of the comments. 
 - The body text of the comment, if available, at the time of transcription.

The above information is saved in the resulting text file and currently is only destroyed manually. In the future, I plan to implement a program to destroy such files after a set period of time, for example one hour.
